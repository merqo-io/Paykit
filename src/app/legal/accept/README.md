# accept

## Purpose

The legal-acceptance interstitial a signed-in vendor is redirected to when
their accepted terms/privacy versions are behind `@merqo/ui`'s
`LEGAL_VERSIONS`. paykit owns no acceptance record — merqo does — so this
folder's job is entirely to collect the vendor's consent and forward it.

## Contents

- `page.tsx` — `LegalAcceptPage`. Reads the `next` search param (through
  `safeRedirectPath`, `@merqo/ui`) and renders the client form.
  Deliberately runs no legal-gate check itself — it is what the gate
  redirects to, so gating it would loop.
- `accept-form.tsx` — `AcceptForm`, a client component wrapping `@merqo/ui`'s
  `TermsAcceptanceCheckbox` (just the agree checkbox — no typed name); the
  submit button is disabled until it's checked. Posts to `acceptLegalTerms`.
- `actions.ts` — `acceptLegalTerms` server action. Re-checks for a signed-in
  user (redirects to `/login` otherwise), reads the vendor's real
  `ip`/`user_agent`, then `POST`s `/api/merqo/legal-accept` on merqo once
  per doc type (`terms`, `privacy`), each independent so a
  duplicate-acceptance conflict on one never blocks the other. The
  recorded `doc_sha256` hashes `getLegalDocSource(docType, "paykit")` —
  the same kit-scoped content `terms/page.tsx` actually renders, not the
  full multi-kit annex. On success it primes the local `legal_check_state`
  cache and redirects to a `safeRedirectPath`-checked `next` (default
  `/dashboard`).
- `actions.test.ts` — covers the two independent posts, the cache prime,
  `next`-param safety, and the no-user/missing-secret branches, and a
  non-2xx throw.

## Shared package note

`safeRedirectPath` now comes from `@merqo/ui` (v0.31.0) rather than `@merqo/ui`.

## Tab title

`page.tsx` exports `metadata.title = "Accept the updated terms"`, which the root layout's `%s | Paykit` template turns into "Accept the updated terms | Paykit". `src/app/page-titles.test.ts` checks it.
