# legal

## Purpose

The public legal-document pages and the acceptance interstitial. Content lives
in `@merqo/ui` (one source, shared by merqo and every kit); paykit only routes
to it and, on `accept/`, records the vendor's acceptance with merqo.

## Contents

- `terms/page.tsx` — `TermsPage`, a one-line Server Component rendering
  `@merqo/ui`'s `<LegalDocument doc="terms" />` (the component brings its own
  `mx-auto max-w-3xl` prose container, so there's no local layout).
- `privacy/page.tsx` — `PrivacyPage`, the same for `<LegalDocument doc="privacy" />`.
- `accept/page.tsx` — `LegalAcceptPage`. The interstitial
  `getVendorSession` (`@/lib/vendor-session`) redirects a signed-in vendor to
  when their accepted terms/privacy versions are behind `@merqo/ui`'s
  `LEGAL_VERSIONS`. Reads the `next` search param (through
  `safeRedirectPath`, `@merqo/ui`) and renders the client form.
  Deliberately runs **no** legal-gate check itself — it is what the gate
  redirects to, so gating it would loop.
- `accept/accept-form.tsx` — `AcceptForm`, a client component wrapping
  `@merqo/ui`'s `TermsAcceptanceCheckbox` (just the agree checkbox — no
  typed name); the submit button is disabled until it's checked. Posts to
  `acceptLegalTerms`.
- `accept/actions.ts` — `acceptLegalTerms` server action. Re-checks for a
  signed-in user (redirects to `/login` otherwise), reads the vendor's
  real `ip`/`user_agent` (via `headers()`/`clientIp` from
  `@/lib/rate-limit`, since this action runs on the vendor's own browser
  submission), then `POST`s `/api/merqo/legal-accept` on merqo once per
  doc type (`terms`, `privacy`) — bearer-authed with
  `MERQO_CUSTOMER_SECRET`, `kit_slug: "paykit"`, each body carrying the
  SHA-256 of that doc's `getLegalDocSource(...)`. Each call is
  independent, and merqo maps a duplicate `(email, doc_type, doc_version)`
  to a success, so a conflict on one doc never blocks the other. On
  success it primes the local `legal_check_state` cache to
  `is_current = true` and redirects to a `safeRedirectPath`-checked `next`
  (default `/dashboard`).
- `accept/actions.test.ts` — covers the two independent posts (asserting
  `ip`/`user_agent` land in both bodies), the cache prime, `next`-param
  safety (absolute / protocol-relative rejected), the no-user and
  missing-secret branches, and a non-2xx throw.

## Connectivity

paykit owns no acceptance record — merqo does (`merqo.legal_acceptances`). The
gate that sends vendors here lives in `@/lib/legal-gate`
(`requireCurrentLegalAcceptance`), wired into `getVendorSession`
(`@/lib/vendor-session`) — paykit's single vendor-gate entry point, called by
every dashboard page/action. `terms/` and `privacy/` are also linked from the
landing footer (`@merqo/ui`'s `LegalFooterLinks` in
`src/components/site-footer.tsx`).
