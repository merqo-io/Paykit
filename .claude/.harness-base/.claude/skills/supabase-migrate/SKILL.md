description: Apply Supabase schema migrations, with a safety gate; DB types in src/lib/db-types/ are updated by hand.

paykit uses Supabase (Postgres + RLS), not Drizzle. Migrations live in
`supabase/migrations/`.

## Apply schema

**Local (Dockerized dev) — the default for day-to-day work:**

- `supabase migration up` — apply pending migrations to the running local DB.
  (Or `supabase db reset` to rebuild local from `supabase/migrations/` + re-run
  the seed — destructive to local data only.)

**Linked (hosted) project — only when intentionally changing the deployed DB:**

- `supabase db push` — applies pending migrations to the linked project.

**Without the CLI:**

- Paste the migration SQL into Supabase → SQL Editor → Run.

## Types

DB types are hand-maintained, never generated. After each migration, update the
matching file in `src/lib/db-types/`. `src/lib/types.ts` is only the barrel that
re-exports them and must never be overwritten. Keep `Relationships` on each table
and the `Views`/`Functions`/`CompositeTypes` keys, or supabase-js types resolve
to `never`.

## Safety gate (before running against a non-local project)

- Confirm the linked project ref is correct: `supabase projects list`.
- RLS must stay enabled on `vendor_payment_config`, `transactions`, `refunds`,
  `kit_api_keys`, `feedback` — never disable it to make a query work; fix the
  policy or the query instead.
- `kit_api_keys` must never grant `authenticated`/`anon` any access — it's
  service-role only.
