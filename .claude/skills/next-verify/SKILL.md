description: Run typecheck + lint + test suite for this project in one pass.
allowed-tools: "Bash(pnpm *)"

Run `pnpm check && pnpm test && pnpm build` and report the results.

- `pnpm check` = `prettier --check` + `eslint` + `tsc --noEmit`; `pnpm test` = `vitest run`; `pnpm build` = `next build`, which catches client/server bundle-boundary errors the other two miss.
- On failure, surface the failing output so it gets fixed at the root — never
  skip, `.skip`, or disable a check or test just to go green.

Note: the harness already covers part of this — the PostToolUse hook runs
incremental `tsc` after each edit and the Stop hook runs `pnpm test`. This skill's
unique value is the lint + format gate (no hook runs those) plus one full-suite
pass on demand.
